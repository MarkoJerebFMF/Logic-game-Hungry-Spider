# Logic game Hungry Spider

Reposotory contains code for all projects in course Programming 2, which is tought by prof. Andrej Bauer on Faculty for Mathematics and Physics in University of Ljubljana.

## Logic game, dots & boxes

For the first project we will develop and test a simple game that uses game logic of dots & boxes. The entire project is developed with python 3 and TkInker GUI. The game will use a simple spider object that emits two diferent colors of "silk/web" (line) for each player. When one of the players forms a rectangle with the "web", this player gets that many points that are at the center of the rectangle. The player with the most points at the end of the game wins.
