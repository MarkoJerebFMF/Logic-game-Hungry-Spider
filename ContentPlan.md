## Application/Game description

In the main window of application there are two players playing the game of Hungry Spider ([dots and boxes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dots_and_Boxes)).
Either of the players could be human, computer or both. Human player must connect the dots (on the screen) with a mouse in a square so that he get's the
points (points are visible) that are assigned to that square (some are equal and some have different value).

The game (application) is in 3 stages: 

1. The beginning (user select how he wishes to play the game):
   * human vs. another human
   * human vs. computer (human has the first move)
   * computer vs. human (computer has the first move)
   * computer vs. computer (user watches)
2. Game - when we play the game we have the following information:
   * current position
   * who is currently on the move
3. Game over - shows which player/computer won and what was the score.
